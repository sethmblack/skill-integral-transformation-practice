## The Triple Transformation Framework

Sri Aurobindo describes transformation as proceeding through three stages, each building on the previous:

### Stage 1: Psychic Transformation

**The Goal:** The psychic being (evolving soul) comes forward to govern the nature.

**Signs of Progress:**
- Growing sense of inner guidance distinct from mental reasoning
- Spontaneous devotion, love, aspiration arising naturally
- Ego-centered reactions becoming more transparent and workable
- Sincerity and truthfulness becoming non-negotiable
- Sense of being led by something deeper than preference

**Key Practices:**
- Turning inward to contact the heart-center
- Cultivating sincerity in all things
- Following inner guidance over mental calculation
- Offering all experiences to the Divine
- Allowing devotion to arise naturally

**Obstacles:**
- Ego maintaining control through spiritual ideas
- Vital desires disguised as soul-movements
- Mental concepts mistaken for direct contact
- Impatience demanding premature results

### Stage 2: Spiritual Transformation

**The Goal:** Opening to planes above ordinary mind; descent of higher consciousness.

**Signs of Progress:**
- Experiences of peace, wideness, light, power from above
- Moments of cosmic consciousness or universal identity
- Liberation from ego-boundaries in awareness
- Higher mind, illumined mind, intuition becoming accessible
- Growing capacity to remain in higher states

**Key Practices:**
- Meditation opening upward to higher consciousness
- Aspiration calling the descent of light and force
- Establishing equanimity toward all experiences
- Widening consciousness beyond personal boundaries
- Receptivity to the descending Force

**Obstacles:**
- Grasping at experiences rather than allowing them
- Spiritual ambition of the ego
- Mixing of higher light with lower formations
- Imbalance between ascent and descent

### Stage 3: Supramental Transformation

**The Goal:** The Supermind descends into mind, life, body; nature itself is transformed.

**Signs of Progress:**
- Direct knowledge replacing inference and belief
- Unity consciousness stabilizing, not just glimpsed
- Body beginning to respond to supramental influence
- Division and ignorance progressively overcome
- Life itself becoming an expression of divine truth

**Key Practices:**
- Sustained opening to the supramental Force
- Complete surrender of remaining ego-formations
- Patient collaboration with the transforming Power
- Living as instrument of the Divine Will
- Allowing the body to be prepared

**Obstacles:**
- Premature claims of supramental realization
- Physical resistance and inertia
- Subtle ego surviving in spiritual guise
- Impatience with the body's slower transformation

## Diagnostic Questions

### Locating Current Stage

1. **Is there consistent inner guidance that feels different from mental calculation?**
   - Yes: Psychic transformation underway
   - No: Focus on psychic contact first

2. **Are there regular experiences of peace, light, or wideness from above?**
   - Yes: Spiritual transformation beginning
   - No: Continue deepening psychic opening

3. **Is the consciousness stabilizing in a state beyond ego-boundaries?**
   - Yes: Spiritual transformation advancing
   - Occasional: Spiritual transformation early stage
   - No: Focus remains on psychic and early spiritual work

4. **What is the relationship between practice and daily life?**
   - Integrated: Good progress
   - Separate: Integration needed
   - Conflicted: Examine resistance

### Identifying Blocks

1. **Where does ego reassert itself?**
   - In spiritual pride
   - In attachment to experiences
   - In subtle desires disguised as aspiration
   - In impatience and demand

2. **What is the quality of surrender?**
   - Complete
   - Partial (which parts withheld?)
   - Conceptual rather than actual

3. **What is being avoided or resisted?**
   - Specific aspects of transformation
   - Surrender of cherished positions
   - Changes in outer life

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I've been meditating daily for five years. I have experiences of peace and sometimes a sense of expansion beyond my body. But I keep getting caught in reactions—anger, judgment, desire. It feels like my meditation and my life are two different things. How do I actually transform?"

**Output:**

## Integral Transformation Assessment

### Current Stage
You are in the early-to-middle phase of **psychic transformation** with beginning touches of **spiritual transformation**. The experiences of peace and expansion indicate genuine contact with higher planes, but the psychic being has not yet come forward sufficiently to govern the nature.

### Active Elements
- **Psychic:** Awakening but not yet governing. Evidence: continued reactivity, sense of split between practice and life.
- **Spiritual:** Beginning. Evidence: experiences of peace, expansion beyond body.
- **Supramental:** Distant preparation. Not the current focus.

### Strengths
- Five years of consistent practice demonstrates genuine aspiration
- Capacity to enter meditative states
- Clear perception of the gap between experience and transformation
- Honest self-assessment without spiritual pretension

### Growth Edges
- Integration of meditative consciousness into daily life
- Psychic being coming forward to govern reactions
- Transformation of the vital nature (emotional reactions)
- Bridge between sitting practice and active life

### Primary Recommendation
**Focus on the psychic being coming forward, not on achieving more meditation experiences.**

The experiences you have in meditation are real but they remain "visits" rather than "residence." The key is not more experiences but bringing the psychic influence into the moments of reaction. When anger arises, that is the moment of practice. When judgment appears, that is where transformation happens—not later in meditation, but right then.

### Supporting Practices

1. **Pause and turn within at the moment of reaction** - When anger or judgment arises, before acting, take even three seconds to turn to the heart-center. Not to analyze but to contact the deeper part. This is more important than extending your meditation time.

2. **Offer reactions to the Divine** - When a reaction happens, consciously give it. "This anger I offer to you. Transform it." This prevents suppression while not allowing indulgence.

3. **Brief practice throughout the day** - Five minutes of turning within, several times daily, is more integrating than one long session that leaves the rest of life unchanged.

4. **Notice when the psychic does speak** - It comes as a quiet certainty, different from mental reasoning or vital preference. Learn its signature. Follow it in small things to strengthen the connection.

### Orientation
Do not see the reactivity as failure but as the precise material of transformation. A sadhak (practitioner) who has no reactions is not transforming—there is nothing to transform. The reactions rising up are opportunities, not setbacks. Meet them not with self-condemnation but with the triple labour: aspiration for transformation, rejection of the movement's governance, surrender of the outcome to the Divine.

### The Path Forward
You are not going in circles. The very fact that you perceive the gap between meditation and life is progress—previously, you might not have noticed. The psychic being is awakening; that is why the split becomes visible. Continue with patience and steady aspiration. The integration you seek will come not through force but through the psychic taking its rightful place. Then meditation and life will no longer be separate, because both will be expressions of the same inner truth.
